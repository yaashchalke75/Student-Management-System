On November 30, 2024, I had the opportunity to complete a machine test at Bitcode Technologies. The task was to create a Student Management System using React. The application needed to allow users to add and delete students using a fake API available online.

I'm happy to share that I successfully completed the task, and you can check out the code on my GitHub.
